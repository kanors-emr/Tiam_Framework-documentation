The TIAM Framework
==================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TIAM (the TIMES Integrated Assessment Model) is a bottom-up, technology rich, least-cost optimization, multi-regional global integrated assessment model,
which is developed using the TIMES model generator of IEA-ETSAP.

* Rapid construction of Global TIMES models that focus on particular countries or regions – to serve as worthy starting points for further refinement with country and domain experts.
* Models are deployed online – fully functional via Internet Browsers.

    * Model building needs other tools, but incremental changes and runs can be performed online.

Why TIAM Framework?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Model building is time consuming especially with a rich framework like TIMES
* Energy transition is increasingly complex
* Need for different geographical coverage and aggregation
* Need for flexibility – ability to aggregate across regions and need for 
* Dynamic temporal resolution is often required in model testing so ideally ability to make this possible at run time
* Not all research questions require the greatest detail possible
* High quality granular data that provides a good starting point to be reviewed with country experts
* **Easy and full accessibility and control for domain experts to engage with. TIMES knowledge should NOT be a prerequisite.**
