Primary energy supply
#####################

* 7 non-renewable energy carriers (list HERE), and 21 supply curves (cost-quantity functions) are created for these carriers for each model region. These curves are anchored by the base year quantity which are the primary production quantities from the IEA energy balance in 2019
* Base prices are assumed based on the prevailing global price in 2019
* Elasticities are tuned to follow the price trajectories reported in the IEA scenarios. Regional differences are based on remaining reserves.
* Biomass supply curves based on IIASA GLOBIOM data. Data for 10 World regions is downscaled to country level based on 2019 Primary biomass production from IEA.
