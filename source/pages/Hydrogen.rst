Hydrogen
########

* Production of hydrogen is possible from multiple technologies to produce "grey", "blue" "turquoise" or "green" hydrogen
* Hydrogen production can be coupled with intermittent electricity production which is modelled in detail using a relatively detailed sub-annual time-slice approach for each modelling period 
* Demand side technologies for the use of hydrogen include consumption in the industrial sectors, in transportation and the possibility of mixing in natural gas distribution systems
