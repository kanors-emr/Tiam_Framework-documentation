* Fuel consumption by road, rail, shipping and aviation sourced from IEA energy balance
* Road is split into heavy trucks, light trucks, buses, cars, 2- and 3-wheel
* Road is modelled on a technology basis with stock representation, non-road transport on a fuel substitution basis
* Starting values for vehicle fuel efficiency, mileage per year, vehicle stock are sourced from reputable sources (eg NEMS, JRC-EU-TIMES, others) and are adjusted to match the total fuel consumption reported in IEA energy balance
