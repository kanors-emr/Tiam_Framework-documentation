##################

* As a demand driven model TIAM requires projection of the main demand drivers to project useful energy demands in the future. A list of the demands can be seen in the following table.

* Activity drivers such as GDP and population are sourced from SSP database
* Household estimates are calculated as half the population from 18-65 yo
* World Bank Development Indicators are used to split the GDP in base year and projected to converge to shares observed in industrialised economies in the long-term
