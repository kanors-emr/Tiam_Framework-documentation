Why TIAM Framework?
===================

* Model building is time consuming especially with a rich framework like TIMES
* Energy transition is increasingly complex
* Need for different geographical coverage and aggregation
* Need for flexibility – ability to aggregate across regions and need for 
* Dynamic temporal resolution is often required in model testing so ideally ability to make this possible at run time
* Not all research questions require the greatest detail possible
* High quality granular data that provides a good starting point to be reviewed with country experts
* **Easy and full accessibility and control for domain experts to engage with. TIMES knowledge should NOT be a prerequisite.**
